helga-meant-to-say
==================

A helga plugin for users to indicate that they meant to say something differnent from what they did.
This plugin will match replacement syntax like 's/foo/bar/', much like using sed. For example::

    <sduncan> foo is bar
    <sduncan> s/foo/bar/
    <helga> sduncan meant to say: bar is bar
